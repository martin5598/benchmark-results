# benchmark-results

This is a collection of the benchmark results, from my master's thesis (Evaluation Techniques for Algebraic Answer Set Counting Over Idempotent Semirings), for evaluating a preprocessor for aspmc (https://github.com/raki123/aspmc).

The benchmark instances are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6428320.

This repository also includes the scripts used to parse and plot the results.
